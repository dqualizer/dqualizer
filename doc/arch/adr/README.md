# Architecture Decisions Records

This folder captures Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs). 

Each file contains an ADR. The file shall have a meaningful name that reflects the context of the ADR. The file [decision-template.md](decision-template.md) serves as a template that can be copied per ADR.

The sections in an ADR file are based on the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), extended by some optional fields.
