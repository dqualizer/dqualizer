# dqualizer

## Goal
The dqualizer project enables domain-driven runtime quality analysis (RQA) of software systems by leveraging Domain Driven Design techniques. In particular, dqualizer focuses on domain-driven monitoring, load testing, and resilience testing.

## Overview

The dqualizer approach consists of six components with different responsibilities:

[%autowidth]
|===
|**Component** |**Short Description**

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqualizer[dqualizer]
|The main repository contains elements that are related to all components, e.g., documentation.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqanalyzer[dqanalyzer]
|The dqanalyzer component enables domain experts to specify and perform RQA without profound knowledge of the underlying technical infrastructure and analysis tools, e.g., by annotating elements in domain stories.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqcockpit[dqcockpit] |
Dqcockpit is a dashboard visualizing the results of executed RQAs.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqedit[dqedit]
|The dqedit component is the editor for the mapping necessary to translate domain questions / RQA definitions to technical RQA configurations.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqtranslator[dqtranslator]
|Dqtranslator maps (domain) RQA definitions to technical RQA configurations that can be executed by dqexec. It also maps the technical results back to the domain level.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqexec[dqexec]
|The dqexec component executes the RQA configuration by utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring, load testing, and resilience testing tooling.

|https://github.com/dqualizer/dqlang[dqlang]
|The dqlang is a collection of languages utilized by dqualizer e.g., the DST extension for domain-level RQA specification or the language for defining mappings in dqedit.
