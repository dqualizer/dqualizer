## How to use the Antora Docs

For using a local directory you need to clone the repo with the documentation locally into
the [local-repos](./local-repos) folder and edit the [antora-local-playbook.yml](antora-local-playbook.yml) like in the
example

If you finished development, push the docs into the corresponding repo and add the url and the branch, if needed default
is main, to
the [antora-playbook.yml](antora-playbook.yml) and push to the docs branch of the dqualizer main repo

### UI Development

The Source files for the ui are located in the ```documentation/src/``` folder.
You can test your changes to the UI by running the ```gulp bundle``` command inside ```documentation/``` folder. The
UI-Bundle is generated by the Pipeline
